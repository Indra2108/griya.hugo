# *About*

## Me

I'm Indra Damar Jati (*kunya ابو الحسن*). I am a Software Developer who specializes in Mobile Development based in Yogyakarta, Indonesia.

I wrote my first line of code when I was still in high school. I learned to use Batch Scripts in Windows.

Currently, I'm studying and mentoring at [Pondok Teknologi](https://pondokteknologi.com/) (formerly [Pesantren IT](https://pesantrenit.com/)), an informal education in Yogyakarta that focuses on IT skill development and Islamic education. I am entrusted to be a React Native Mentor, guiding Santri in building mobile applications, especially for Android.

Besides coding, another thing I enjoy is writing. I love jotting down my random thoughts, knowledge, and even crazy ideas in physical journals, like books, or digital platforms such as knowledge bases or blogs. One of my biggest dream is become a Writer, especially like a Technical Writer and Digital Storyteller. I have a telegram channel, [@NaNreading](https://t.me/NaNreading) which is a curated list of articles or websites with blogs worth reading. I created it to improve writing skills because I believe that *The More You Read, The More You Write...*

Anyway, here's some of my interests, if you're curious:

- Functional Programming (FP) such as Haskell (mostly), Lisp-family, and Scala. I love the straightforwardness and simplicity of FP.
- Decentralized internet. such as Indie Web, Webrings, and everything in-between because [small web is beautiful](https://benhoyt.com/writings/the-small-web-is-beautiful/).
- Retro computing. such as emulation, classic hardware, and the like. (even I still don't know how a computer 'exactly' works, but ironically, I still love this topic, haha). Anyway, I have a Nintendo DS in my home, and I'm planning to make a little research about [uxn](https://wiki.xxiivv.com/site/uxn.html), and running it through my DS for learning purpose.
- Low-tech. since I've read a bit about [Frugal computing](https://wimvanderbauwhede.codeberg.page/articles/frugal-computing/) and [Low-tech magazine](https://solar.lowtechmagazine.com/) and then seen the environmental conditions in my country, I have become more aware of the environment.

And lastly, here's my [twitter](https://twitter.com/Indradamarj).

## Site

I wrote this personal website using plain HTML & CSS, except for my bookmarks, which are based on Hamish's bookmarking tool that use JavaScript for manipulating DOM.

This site use two fonts, Amiri for arabic letter and Ysabeau for main text.

This personal website design is heavily-inspired by [Azlen Elza](https://azlen.me/) and [Anirudh Oppiliappan](https://icyphox.sh/).

This site is hosted by [Firebase Hosting](https://firebase.google.com/docs/hosting).
